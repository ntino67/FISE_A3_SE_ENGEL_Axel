This is a test

Software Engineering is the systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.
In simple terms:

It’s about building software correctly, efficiently, and reliably, just like engineers build bridges or design cars.

It goes beyond just coding. It involves careful planning, designing, testing, maintaining, and managing software projects to meet customer needs and business goals.

From your links, key points are:

1. From the KnowledgeHut article: Best Practices in Software Development
Systematic Approach: Good software doesn’t happen by accident. Developers follow structured steps — like requirement gathering, system design, coding, testing, and deployment.

Focus on Quality: You don't just want software that works; you want software that is high quality — meaning it’s secure, maintainable, efficient, and user-friendly.

Collaboration and Communication: Teams must work together and keep stakeholders (clients, users, etc.) in the loop.

Continuous Improvement: Software engineering is about always refining methods, learning from mistakes, and staying updated with new technologies and practices.

2. From the SEI (Software Engineering Institute) website
The SEI (part of Carnegie Mellon University) is a world leader in setting standards and methods for software engineering. They emphasize:

Disciplined Development: Using proven methods (like Agile, CMMI, DevSecOps) to make software predictable and repeatable.

Measurement and Improvement: Understanding how software processes work and continuously measuring and improving them.

Security and Resilience: Software should not just function, but be secure and resilient against threats.

3. From JavaTpoint's article on Software Quality
Software Quality is a huge part of software engineering.

Good software must meet:

Functional Requirements: It does what users need.

Non-Functional Requirements: It’s fast, secure, reliable, maintainable.

Two aspects of software quality:

Quality Assurance (QA): Making sure the process to build software is good.

Quality Control (QC): Making sure the final software product is good.

They also point out characteristics of good software:

Correctness

Reliability

Efficiency

Integrity

Usability

Maintainability

Flexibility

Portability

Reusability

Interoperability

In Short:

Software Engineering is...	Not just...
About designing, building, testing, maintaining software systematically	About quickly writing code
Focused on quality, efficiency, security, maintainability	Focused only on making it work
Following engineering principles and standards	Improvising with no structure
